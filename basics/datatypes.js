/* #Dynamically typed languages: Check variable types at runtime, while the code is running.
Statically typed languages: Check variable types at compile time, before the code is run.
JS is a dynamically typed language 

   #types of datatypes(depending on the memory allocation)  -->  primitive and non primitives
 1. primitive : 7 categories ( string , number, boolean , undefined , symbol, BigInt, null  )
                to declare a symbol- 
                    constId=Symbol("123")              

    if you check the data type of null it will say object 

 2. non primitive or refrence type (direct ref. can be allocated in the memory) : 
 *Array-
    const heores = [1,2,3,4,5]
*object-
    let myObject{
    name:"toshika",
    age:22
    }
*function-
    const myFunction = funtion(){
    console.log("hello-world-yara")
    }
